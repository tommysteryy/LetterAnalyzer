# Letter Analysis 
### A NLP Project by Tommy Xu

Upon using various math textbooks throughout my first few years of
university studying Statistics & Computer Science, I (like many others) was
truly humbled by the use of letters in higher level mathematics. 
It starts with "f", "x", and "y" in high school, then we add on "z" and "w" in
university calculus, then a bunch of "a", "b", "c" for arbitrary integers and 
"g" and "h" for relations & functions in discrete mathematics. This sounds simple, but
it was never easy for me. 

I noticed how using "x" and "z" is **very normal** in math language, but I can barely 
think of many *regular* words that use the letter "x" other than "x-ray" and "xylophone". 
Also, It seemed to me that **letter usage (particularly of "x", "y", "z", and others) 
in math textbooks increased as we increased the difficulty (and usually the level of abstraction) 
of the course**. This led to two research questions:

1) Are there significant differences in letter usage between mathematics textbooks of 
the **same topic** but of **different difficulty** levels?
   - Letter usage will be measured in **relative letter frequency (RLF)** (# of particular letter 
     occurrences / total letter occurrences)
   - The mathematics topics explored include algebra, calculus, and statistics, and will 
     mostly use textbooks by the same team for different year levels.
     
     
2) Are there statistical differences between letter usage patterns of math textbooks 
   and mainstream forms of written media?
   - Letter usage pattern will be generated by plotting letter frequency for each letter,
     and connecting the dots to form a line. Examples are shown in Figure 1a.
